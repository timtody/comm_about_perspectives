# Learning To Improve Representations by Communicating About Perspectives

This is the code repository for our paper "Learning To Improve Representations by Communicating About Perspectives", which is currently under review at NeurIPS 2021. A prelimiary version of the paper can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12jiAi9Xqq04RYj-vWK_z2wapRaOaQdqO/view?usp=sharing), though it is subject to a lot of changes in the near future.

## Summary
At the core of artificial agents lie their representations of the world around them. Inpsired by research that views language as a cognitive tool as well as works that link population size to simplicity in language, we hypothesise that such a link can be shown in an emergent communication setup and then later exploited for downstream tasks.
